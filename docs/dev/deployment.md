# Deployment

## Prerequisites

The application consists of two repositories: a [Spark-powered Java backend](https://github.com/conveyal/datatools-server) and a [Javascript frontend written with React and Redux](https://github.com/conveyal/datatools-ui). To install and deploy the application, you will need Java 8, Maven, Node/npm, yarn, and [mastarm](https://github.com/conveyal/mastarm).

User authentication is done via [Auth0](http://auth0.com). You will need an Auth0 account and application to use the Data Manager.

## Installation and Basic Configuration

Clone the repo and change to the project directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/conveyal/datatools-ui.git
$ git clone https://github.com/conveyal/datatools-server.git
```

Copy the included configuration `env` templates for both the server and UI repos:

```bash
$ cp datatools-ui/configurations/default/env.yml.tmp datatools-ui/configurations/default/env.yml
$ cp datatools-server/configurations/default/env.yml.tmp datatools-server/configurations/default/env.yml
```

You'll then need to supply Auth0 account information (see below) and API keys for various services used in the application.

The default `server.yml` (for `datatools-server`) and `settings.yml` (for `datatools-ui`) should work out of the box, but you may want to specify alternative settings files outside of these repositories. These can be specified as a directory during `datatools-ui` build with mastarm:

```bash
$ mastarm build --config /path/to/configurations/dir
```

AND as individual file args for `datatools-server`:

```bash
$ java -jar target/dt-v1.0.0.jar /path/to/env.yml /path/to/server.yml
```
In `datatools-server:server.yml`, be sure to update the paths for where the databases will be stored:

```yaml
application:
  data:
    mapdb: /path/to/mapdb
    gtfs: /path/to/gtfs
    editor_mapdb: /path/to/editor
    regions: /path/to/regions/geojson
```
### Setting up Auth0

#### Creating account and application (client)
1. Create an [Auth0](https://auth0.com) account (free).
2. Once you've created an Auth0 account, create an application (client) in Auth0 to use with the Data Manager with the following settings:
    - enable only `Username-Password-Authentication` connections (i.e., turn off Google)
    - set `Use Auth0 instead of the IdP to do Single Sign On` to true
    - update the following application- and account-level settings to include `http://localhost:9000` (or the domain where the application will be hosted):
        - Account level (Account Settings > Advanced)
            - Allowed logout URLs
        - Application level
            - Allowed Callback URLs
            - Allowed Origins (CORS)
    - keep all other default settings

#### Creating your first user
Create your first Auth0 user through Auth0 web console (Users > Create User). In addition to an email and password, you'll need to supply the user with the following default application admin `app_metadata` (`user_metadata` should remain empty):

```json
{
  "datatools": [{
    "permissions": [
      {
        "type": "administer-application"
      }
    ],
    "subscriptions": [],
    "projects": [],
    "client_id": "your-auth0-client-id"
  }]
}
```

#### Update `env.yml` for both
Update the following properties in **both** `env.yml` files to reflect the public Auth0 application settings:

```yaml
AUTH0_DOMAIN: your-auth0-domain.auth.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: your-auth0-client-id
```

Update the following properties in `datatools-server` `env.yml` to reflect the secure Auth0 application settings:

```yaml
AUTH0_SECRET: your-auth0-client-secret
AUTH0_TOKEN: your-auth0-api-token
```

**Note**: to generate the `api_token`, go to Documentation > Management API. After adding scopes, your token will appear in the input field.

![Auth0 token generator](../img/auth0-token-generator.png)

To allow for the creation, deletion and editing of users you must generate a token for the following scopes:

- **users**:
    - read, update, create and delete
- **users_app_metadata**:
    - read, update, create and delete`

## Building and Running the Application

Install the Javascript dependencies using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn
```

Build and deploy the frontend to s3 using npm script (which calls [mastarm](https://github.com/conveyal/mastarm)):

```bash
$ npm run deploy -- s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/dist
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
```

Package the application using Maven:

```bash
$ mvn package
```

Deploy the application with Java:

```bash
$ java -jar target/dt-v1.0.0.jar /path/to/env.yml /path/to/server.yml
```


The application back-end should now be running at `http://localhost:9000` (or whatever port you specified in `server.yml`).
The front-end assets are pointed to by the back end at whatever s3 bucket name is specified in `server.yml` at `application.assets_bucket`.

## Configuring Modules

The application contains a number of optional modules that each require their own configuration settings and resources. At minimum, each module must be set to `enabled: true` and may require additional configuration.

### Editor

Enables the GTFS Editor module.

#### List of configuration settings

- `MAPZEN_TURN_BY_TURN_KEY`
- `MAPBOX_MAP_ID`
- `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `R5_URL` (optional parameter for r5 routing in editor pattern drawing)

### Validator

While the application handles basic validation even without the validator module enabled, the validator allows for enhanced accessibility- and map-based validation.

#### List of configuration settings

- `OSM_VEX` - `datatools-server:env.yml` the validator requires the URL of a running instance of the [OSM vex server](https://github.com/conveyal/vanilla-extract).


### Sign Configurations

Enables the sign configuration module.

#### List of configuration settings

- `use_extension` - extension key to use for sign configuration
- `url`
- Requires `gtfsapi` module

### Alerts

Enables the real-time alerts module.

#### List of configuration settings

- `use_extension` - extension key to use for sign configuration
- `url`
- Requires `gtfsapi` module

### GTFS+ (`gtfsplus`)

Enables the GTFS+ module.

### Deployment

Enables the OTP automated deployments module.

#### List of configuration settings

- `OSM_VEX` - `datatools-server:env.yml`  the validator requires the URL of a running instance of the [OSM vex server](https://github.com/conveyal/vanilla-extract).

### GTFS API

Supports other modules with API endpoints for getting GTFS entities (routes, stops, etc.)

#### List of configuration settings

- `load_on_fetch` - whether to load GTFS feeds when new feed is detected
- `load_on_startup` - whether to load GTFS feeds on application startup
- `use_extension` - which extension to connect to
- `update_frequency` - update frequency for GTFS API (in seconds). Comment out to disable updates.

## Configuring Extensions

The application supports integration with several third-party resources for retrieving feeds.

### Integration with [transit.land](https://transit.land/)

Ensure that the `extensions:transitland:enabled` flag is set to `true` in `config.yml`:

```yaml
extensions:
  transitland:
    enabled: true
    api: https://transit.land/api/v1/feeds
```

### Integration with [TransitFeeds](http://transitfeeds.com/)

Ensure that the `extensions:transitfeeds:enabled` flag is set to `true` in `config.yml`, and provide your API key:

```yaml
extensions:
  transitfeeds:
    enabled: true
    api: http://api.transitfeeds.com/v1/getFeeds
    key: your-api-key
```
